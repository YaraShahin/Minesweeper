	1. Install the raspian
	2. Memory card: Create blank file called ssh with no extension
	3. Memory card: create file "wpa_supplicant.conf":

	country=eg
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
	network={
 scan_ssid=1
 ssid="MyNetworkSSID"
 psk="Pa55w0rd1234"
}

	4. Connect the sd to the pi and it should connect to the network (u need to have the laptop and the pi on the same network for this to work)
	5. Use ssh pi@raspberrypi  command in your command prompt and enter the password "raspberry"
	6. In the VNC viewer, type raspberry (or whatever the raspberry pi name is, you'll see it in the hotspot connected list)


Notes: if the red is blinking, low power supply. 
If green is blinking, this is good. Keep going.
